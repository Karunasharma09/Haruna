Haruna: Personalized AI desktop voice assistant
I created an AI desktop voice assistant named ”Haruna” using
Python and its libraries and modules. It performs various task on
voice command such as sending E-mails, opening websites like
Google, Youtube, Stackoverflow etc, can do Wikipedia searches
without opening web browsers. It can perform many other daily
tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command.
